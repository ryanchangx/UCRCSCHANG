; Set up flags, counters, accumulators as needed

; Get first character, test for '\n', '+', '-', digit/non-digit 	
					
					; is very first character = '\n'? if so, just quit (no message)!

					; is it = '+'? if so, ignore it, go get digits

					; is it = '-'? if so, set neg flag, go get digits
					
					; is it < '0'? if so, it is not a digit	- o/p error message, start over

					; is it > '9'? if so, it is not a digit	- o/p error message, start over
				
					; if none of the above, first character is first numeric digit - convert it to number & store in target register!
					
; Now get remaining digits from user in a loop (max 5), testing each to see if it is a digit, and build up number in accumulator

					; remember to end with a newline!

; PURPOSE of PROGRAM
;-------------------
; Convert a sequence of up to 5 user-entered ascii numeric digits into a 16-bit two's complement binary representation of the number.
; if the input sequence is less than 5 digits, it will be user-terminated with a newline (ENTER).
; Otherwise, the program will emit its own newline after 5 input digits.
; The program must end with a *single* newline, entered either by the user (< 5 digits), or by the program (5 digits)
; Input validation is performed on the individual characters as they are input, but not on the magnitude of the number.
